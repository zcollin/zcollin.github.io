    <h4><strong>Testing Your Code</strong></h4>
    <p>
      If you are working within the course repository, you should now have some
      tools available to check whether your labs pass before submission.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You will be working in the<span>&nbsp;</span><span>public</span
        ><span>&nbsp;</span>directory in your lab repository.
      </li>
      <li>
        It should look like this:<br /><br /><img
          src="./public_lab_dir.png"
          alt=""
          width="346"
          height="281"
          data-api-endpoint="https://umd.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/1288484/files/57528075"
          data-api-returntype="File"
          style="max-width: 346px"
        />
      </li>
      <li>
        Open&nbsp;<strong>two (2)&nbsp;</strong>terminal windows in VSCode.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the first one, type<span>&nbsp;</span
        ><span style="background-color: #ccffcc">npm start</span><br />It should
        look like this:<br /><br /><img
          src="./split_terminal-1.png"
          alt="Split terminal window"
          data-api-endpoint="https://umd.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/1288484/files/57895559"
          data-api-returntype="File"
          style="max-width: 1039px"
        />
      </li>
      <li>
        In the second window, type<span>&nbsp;</span
        ><span style="background-color: #ccffcc">npm test&nbsp;</span><br />It
        should look like this:<br /><br /><img
          src="./npm_passing.png"
          alt=""

      </li>
      <li>
        To TURN OFF your server or your testing environment, type
        <span style="background-color: #ccffcc">command-C</span> on Mac or
        follow the instructions
        <a
          href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43531894/ctrlc-does-not-stop-node-server-in-command-line-from-vs-code"

          ></a
        ><br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        It should also open Cypress, a testing environment, for you.<br /><br /><img

    <h4>
      <strong><br />Working With Cypress</strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
      This is a big course - apparently one of the largest here! - and it's
      sometimes easier to ask the computer if your basic code is right than to
      wait for someone to check their e-mail. Computers might be picky about
      what they'll accept, but they don't get bored the way grading assistants
      do. Therefore, this course uses something called "test-driven development"
      to get through the early parts of the course. We use Cypress to automate
      those tests, and the same ones are used to grade you later.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Cypress, open the test for the lab you'd like to work on. For this
      "getting started" guide, let's go with Lab 1.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Your lab's super busted! There's nothing really there yet. Your test
        suite should look like this:<br /><br /><img
          src="./failed_cypress.png"
          alt="failed_cypress"
          style="max-width: 1039px"
        /><br /><br />
      </li>
      <li>
        Your goal is to edit your lab in VSCode to answer the lab problems as
        best you can.
      </li>
      <li>
        Every time you think you've improved something enough in your lab, you
        can save and re-test using Cypress.&nbsp;
      </li>
      <li>
        A successful lab will have a bunch of green checkmarks, and pass all of
        the written test cases.
      </li>
      <li>
        It only tests what it tests, so you might do a bunch more or less work,
        but the computer is only checking specific cases. This is a downside to
        automated testing.
      </li>
    </ul>
