    <h1>Re: Dover Cliff university application</h1>

    <p>Dear Dover,</p>

    <p>
      Thank you for your recent application to join us at
      <abbr title="University of Maryland">UMD</abbr>'s
      <abbr title="College of Information Studies">iSchool</abbr> to study for
      your undergraduate in 2020. I will answer your questions one by one, in
      the following sections.
    </p>

    <h2>Starting dates</h2>

    <p>
      We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time,
      however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a
      semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>First semester: <time datetime="2020-08-29">29 August 2020</time></li>
      <li>
        Second semester: <time datetime="2021-01-22">22 January 2021</time>
      </li>
      <li>Third semester: <time datetime="2021-05-02">2 May 2021</time></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would
      prefer.
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>

    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>

    <p>
      At the iSchool, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long
      as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of information studies. You
      seem like a committed researcher, and just the kind of
      person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you
      submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol
        (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures
        exceeding 33°C (91.4°F), when the audience size exponentially increases
        (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <abbr title="hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for
        representing musical scores.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects,
      including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and
      other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
    </p>

    <h2>Animals of the Extended Perambulation</h2>

    <p>
      Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I
      <em>did</em> study animals. To answer your question, my favourite
      creatures are as follows, with definitions:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>The Canadian Polar bear</dt>
      <dd>
        A large predator, <em>very</em> hungry these days. Feeds almost entirely
        on seal.
      </dd>
      <dt>The elk</dt>
      <dd>
        An elk is a horned ungulate found primarily in the mountainous regions
        of British Columbia. It can be seen from railways, and also frequently
        visits the Banff centre for the arts.
      </dd>
      <dt>The red-tailed hawk</dt>
      <dd>
        An interesting example of historic misinformation: many people believe
        eagles make the screaming noise associated with them on film. This cry
        is instead the call of the red-tail.
      </dd>
    </dl>
